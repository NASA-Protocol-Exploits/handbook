# Contributing
Suppose you would like to add to the company GitHub with the intention of helping improve our current documentation. In that case, we encourage all members to do this by sending a [pull request](https://github.com/NASA-Protocol-Exploits/handbook/pulls) to the corresponding repository. Your pull request will then be triaged by the respective employee of a senior position. For any questions, we advise members to use the [issues function](https://github.com/NASA-Protocol-Exploits/handbook/issues). If you are unsure about how GitHub works, I strongly recommend watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org) video.

Thank you for expressing interest in the project and wanting to help! We want to make this a welcoming environment for everyone interested in contributing.
