# Glossary of Terms
**AMS (Asynchronous Message Service) –** AMS is an Asynchronous Message Service (On the application layer) for use in space, e.g., between Earth and spacecraft in Earth orbit or between Earth and spacecraft on interplanetary missions.

**AOS (Acquisition of Signal) -** Acquisition of Signal (or Satellite) is the time that a satellite rises above the horizon of an observer.

**Bent-Pipe –** In reference to satellites, Bent-Pipe repeaters are also known as transparent repeaters or non-regenerative repeaters because they capture the signal from Earth and redirect it back without demodulating. The uplink signal is amplified and "repeated" on a new downlink frequency.

**BP (Bundle Protocol) –** The DTN analogue to the Internet Protocol (IP) is called “Bundle Protocol”. BP provides Network Layer service to applications allowing them to utilize BP’s capabilities (i.e., custody-based retransmission, ability to cope with intermittent connectivity, ability to take advantage of scheduled, predicted, and opportunistic connectivity) (in addition to continuous connectivity) and notional data accountability with built-in status reporting.

**CCSDS (Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems)** - The CCSDS is a multi-national forum for the development of communications & data systems standards for spaceflight.

**CFDP (CCSDS File Delivery Protocol)** - CFDP is a file transfer protocol (On the application layer) for use in space, e.g., between Earth and spacecraft in Earth orbit or between Earth and spacecraft on interplanetary missions.

**DGR (Datagram Retransmission)** – An alternative implementation of LTP that is designed for use on the internet. It enables data to be transmitted via UDP with reliability comparable to that provided by TCP.

**DSN (Deep Space Network) -** The NASA Deep Space Network is a worldwide network of American spacecraft communication ground segment facilities, located in the United States, Spain, and Australia, that supports NASA's interplanetary spacecraft missions.

**DTN (Disruption Tolerant Networking)** - Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking (DTN) is a suite of standard protocols that use information within the data stream (headers attached to data units) to accomplish end-to-end data delivery through network nodes when paths between those entities is subject to very long signal propagation latency and/or prolonged intervals of unavailability.

**EIDs (Endpoint Identifier)** – An endpoint identifier is used to identify an endpoint on a network. “scheme_name:scheme_specific_part” EIDs or “ipn:node_number.service_number” EID’s are the tokens by which DTN bundles are routed to their destinations, but they are not necessarily addresses because neither of the EID’s are required to have topological significance.

**GEO (Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit)** - A Geosynchronous Equatorial Orbit (GEO) is located exactly 22,336 miles out in space directly above the Earth's equator. A satellite in a GEO orbit takes a full 24 hours to circle the Earth. That means a satellite in GEO is always directly over the same spot-on Earth. GEO can also be called a Geostationary Orbit.

**IOAG (Interagency Operations Advisory Group)** – The Interagency Operations Advisory Group was founded by the Interoperability Plenary (IOP) to Understand issues related to interagency interoperability and other space communications matters, identify solutions complying with IOP policies, and Recommend resolutions to the IOP for specific actions by the IOP.

**ION (Interplanetary Overlay Network)** - Interplanetary Overlay Network (ION) is an implementation of Delay/Disruption Tolerant Networking.

**ISS (International Space Station)** - The International Space Station is a modular space station in low Earth orbit. It is a multinational collaborative project involving five participating space agencies: NASA, Roscosmos, JAXA, ESA, and CSA.

**LEO (Low-Earth Orbit) -** Low-Earth orbit encompasses Earth-centred orbits with an altitude of 2,000 km (1,200 mi) or less.

**LOS (Loss of Signal) -** Loss of Signal (or Satellite) is the time that a satellite passes below the observer’s horizon.

**LTP (Licklider Transmission Protocol) -** Licklider Transmission Protocol is a point-to-point protocol for use in deep space links. LTP is commonly seen as the standard underlying convergence layer protocol for the Bundle Protocols (BP).

**LTPCL (Licklider Transmission Protocol Convergence Layer)** - Licklider Transmission Protocol is a point-to-point protocol for use in deep space links. LTPCL is commonly used to refer to what transport protocol then bundle protocol will be using. (E.g., This could be just when explaining how CFDP will travel from the satellite to the ground station using LTPCL.)

**SSI (Solar System Internetwork)** - The purpose/concept of the SSI is the provision of internetworked data communications services across the Solar System in support of space mission users. The SSI will employ a confederated and interoperable infrastructure of nodes owned and operated by multiple space agencies to achieve a level of service that individual agencies would otherwise be unlikely to achieve.

**TCA (Time of Closet Approach) -** Time of Closest Approach is the time when the satellite is closest to the observer and when Doppler shift is zero. This usually corresponds to the time that the satellite reaches maximum elevation above the horizon.

**TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) -** Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport protocol that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets. TCP includes mechanisms to solve many of the problems that arise from packet-based messaging, such as lost packets, out of order packets, duplicate packets, and corrupted packets.

**TCPCL (Transport Control Protocol Convergence Layer) –** Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport protocol that is used on top of IP to ensure reliable transmission of packets. TCPCL is commonly used to refer to what transport protocol then bundle protocol will be using. E.g., This could be just when explaining how CFDP will travel from the ground station to a satellite facing transmission station over LTPCL.

**TDRS (Tracking and Data Relay Satellite)** - The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite constellation consists of a number of geosynchronous equatorial orbit satellites ([first generation](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/services/networks/txt_tdrs_gen1.html), [second generation](https://www.nasa.gov/directorates/heo/scan/services/networks/txt_tdrs_gen2.html) and [third generation satellites)](https://www.nasa.gov/content/tracking-and-data-relay-satellite-tdrs-third-generation/) distributed over the Atlantic Ocean, Pacific Ocean and Indian Ocean. They provide near continuous bent pipe information relay services to over 25 missions including the ISS.

**UDP (User Datagram Protocol)** - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a communications protocol that is primarily used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet. UDP speeds up transmissions by enabling the transfer of data before an agreement is provided by the receiving party.

**UDPCL (User Datagram Protocol Convergence Layer) –** - User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a communications protocol that is primarily used to establish low-latency and loss-tolerating connections between applications on the internet.  UDPCL is commonly used to refer to what transport protocol then bundle protocol will be using. E.g., This could be just when explaining how CFDP will travel from the ground station to a satellite facing transmission station over LTPCL.

**USLP (Unified Space data Link Protocol)** - The Unified Space Data Link Protocol described herein is intended for missions that are cross-supported between Agencies of the CCSDS. This Recommendation specifies a communications protocol to be used by space missions to transfer space application data over space-to-ground or space-to-space communications links.

**VM (Virtual Machine) -** A virtual machine (VM) is a virtual environment that functions as a virtual computer system with its own CPU, memory, network interface, and storage, created on a physical hardware system (located off- or on-premises).
