# Mission Statement

The NASA Protocol Exploits Team aims to research and evaluate space communications from a security perspective. Our team intends to conduct research and evaluate various protocols and implementations for vulnerabilities, exploits and threats.  

The motivation behind the project is driven by the sensitive nature of data communicated over satellites, which typically has 'security' low on the priority list.   

The company's overall goal is to identify vulnerabilities, exploits and threats through team collaboration within the protocols used inside the DTN Stack and various systems used for space communications and ultimately document successful exploitations, methodologies, and potential remedies.
